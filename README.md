# SFS-DeltaV-Calculator
C# script that calculates DeltaV required to go to any planet in Space Flight Simulator, made by u/pixelgaming579.
Custom planets and engines coming soon.
As of now, this script doesn't include landing and taking off because differences in drag and landing technique would change the Delta V significantly.
Check download folder for downloads. Currently only for Mac and Windows (Dowload the .zip file if using a mac as downloading the plain executable removes the tag that keeps it as an executable).

Download versions:

1.0 - first release, only contains default planets and no rockets. I'm developing this on a Mac so I haven't been able to test windows versions, so I believe windows 1.0 doesn't work.

2.0 - Default engine DeltaV calculator added. Windows version should work now. Bugs relating value input are known and are being worked out.
